# BetaTopics
This is a place where you can find list of useful articles in selected technologies/topics.\
If you prefer full screen view you can find this topics at link: [Beta Topics](https://djolewalker.github.io/BetaTopics/)

Idea of this library **is not to provide tutorials and official documentations** that anyone can reach.
The goal is to have useful articles in one library that will extend you knowledge and make your free moments at work good for your knowledgebase.

Articles are organized in folders per specific technology. 

Each article should be described in couple of words. It would be nice to add some higligths 
words under description that will make topic surfing easier.

Example of an article:

1. **JWT Authentication in React with react-router - [https://dev.to/sanjayttg](https://dev.to/sanjayttg/jwt-authentication-in-react-with-react-router-1d03?utm_source=reactdigest&utm_medium&utm_campaign=1655)**\
   Good example how we can integrate JWT authentication with React and react-router. How to handle public routes, secure authenticated routes.
   Utilize the axios library to make API requests with the authentication token.\
   Highlights: `JWT` `react-router` `axios`

Feel free to participate. Create PR with your suggested articles.
